# Google-Maps-Scraper
This app can access Google Maps instead of you and find the desired types of places (e.g. libraries) at the given coordinates and scrape as many places as you want. To avoid the IP ban risk, the app integrates the Puppeteer with proxy server providers. Therefore, the browser instance generated by Puppeteer performs scraping anonymously.
